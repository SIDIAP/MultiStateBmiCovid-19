# MultiStateBmiCovid-19

This study has been performed on data from the Sistema d’Informació pel Desenvolupament de la Investigació a l’Atenció Primària (SIDIAP) database, linked to COVID-19 PCR testing, hospitalisation, and mortality data, which was mapped to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). 

While <i>data preparation</i> and <i>summary of observed data</i> scripts allow to extract, prepare and inspect data, scripts in <i>analysis</i> folder allow to perform statistical analysis.
Proportionality of hazards can be visually inspected before computing AICs and BICs for the selection of appropriate models. For those, hazard ratios are obtained.
Then, scripts for performing the analysis on multiple imputed data are available.
